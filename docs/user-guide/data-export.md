# Data Export guide

EvoNEST provides export capabilities for all its tables to ensure your research data and results can still be processed using your favourite tools.

## Formats

Tables can be exported as XLSX, CSV or JSON. 

## Filtering

When tables are filtered by any value, the filtering is kept during export. This only influences which rows are exported: all export options always save all the columns, allowing users to use data and metadata during their studies

## Table format

All tables in evonest are in long format. While we do not have yet a long to wide format converter, we advice using R or Python to quickly transform them if needed.
