## Exercise: Spider Silk Research Workflow

Let's work through a realistic example: documenting a spider specimen and measuring its silk properties.

**Scenario:** You've collected a garden spider (*Araneus diadematus*) and want to:
- Document the specimen
- Extract silk samples
- Measure silk diameter
- Test mechanical properties
- Organize everything in an experiment

---

## Step 1: Create a Parent Sample

The parent sample represents the whole organism.

### 1.1 Navigate to Samples

1. **Click "Samples"** in the main navigation

2. **Click "Add Sample"** or "Create Sample" button
   - Usually at the top-right of the samples table

3. **A form will appear** (might be a modal or new page)

### 1.2 Fill in Basic Information

Fill in the following fields:

**Identification:**
- **Sample Name:** Leave blank to auto-generate, or enter: `AranDiad01`
- **Sample Type:** Select `animal` (or your custom type)

**Taxonomy:**
- **Family:** `Araneidae`
- **Genus:** `Araneus`

## Best Practices for Data Entry

### Consistency is Key

- **Use standard taxonomic names** - Check against databases (GBIF, WoRMS)
- **Consistent units** - Always use the same units for each trait type
- **Detailed notes** - Future you will thank past you
- **Regular backups** - Learn more in [Module 6: Backup & Maintenance](/tutorial/06-backup-maintenance)

### Metadata Matters

Always record:
- **When** - Dates for collection, measurements, analysis
- **Where** - Location, equipment, lab conditions
- **Who** - Responsible person, collector, measurer
- **How** - Methods, equipment settings, protocols

### File Organization

- **Name files descriptively** - `AranDiad01_microscope_400x.jpg`
- **Include scale bars** in images
- **Document units** in spreadsheets
- **Use version control** for protocols

### Quality Control

- **Enter replicates** - Multiple measurements improve accuracy
- **Check for typos** - Review before saving
- **Verify units** - Double-check mm vs Î¼m, g vs kg
- **Use logbook** - Document why you made changes
